👋 Hi, I’m Jasmine! I have an education background in accounting and statistics. I have a solid actuarial background but have recently transitioned to the data science field. I've always loved and excelled in math but didn't exactly know where my passions landed. From actuarial analyst -> data quality analyst -> data scientist. My focus is in healthcare analytics but I use this platform to explore all different kinds of data!
