- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jasmine!
I'm looking to use my actuarial science background to step into the world of data science. I want to explore data beyond claims, and do more than performing quantitaive analyses in Excel. Technology continues to evolve and I want to be able to explore new tools to dig through data and make impactful predictions and insights that can help make the world a better place. I'm doing this by learning SQL and Python and utilizing my notes from courses while I was a statistics student a year ago.
